\section*{Scope and falsifiability.}
This paper develops and tests specific aspects of the \emph{Planck-Cell S/t framework}---covering kinematics, mass, gravity, thermodynamics, electromagnetics, or expansion---within a single, self-consistent model. It is not a full textbook; external sources are cited where conventional background is required. All claims apply to \emph{interior regions} of a bounded-degree, approximately isotropic adjacency network in which no entity advances more than one hop per global tick. The framework is immediately falsified by any of the following:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
  \item measurable vacuum group-velocity dispersion in transit speed;
  \item weak-field slopes falling outside the range $\hat\beta \in [0.97,1.03]$ (Eq.~6);
  \item interior distortions exceeding $f(N)$ as defined in Theorem~2; or
  \item reproducible superluminal signalling through nonlocal shortcuts.
\end{enumerate}
