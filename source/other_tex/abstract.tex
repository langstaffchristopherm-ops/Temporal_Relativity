\section*{Abstract}
We remove geometry as an input and let it emerge from uniform causal ticks of entropy--time.
From the minimal postulates $\Delta S = \Delta\tau$ and one--hop--per--tick exchange, we (i) recover ambient
distances from adjacency via a standard interior finite--sample bound with rate $f(N)$ under near--isotropy and
interior sampling, and (ii) check weak--field clock behavior using a preregistered slope estimator
$\hat\beta = (\Delta\nu/\nu)/(\Delta\Phi/c^2)$ with acceptance band $\hat\beta\in[0.97,1.03]$.
Classic redshift/clock experiments fall inside that band. All statements are operational: units enter only at
calibration ($t=t_P\,\tau$, $S_{\rm phys}=k_B S$). Figures and numbers are ; archives
contain exact commands for reproducibility.

We interpret $c$ as the local causal \emph{stitch rate} (Def.~\ref{def:stitch}): in native units $\mathrm{d}a/\mathrm{d}\tau=1$ (one hop per tick), and in SI units $c=\ell_0/t_0$ after calibration to physical rulers.
