\section*{Introduction}

The \emph{Temporal Relativity} paper introduces the foundational idea that
geometry, distance, and metric relations are not primitive inputs but emergent
products of causal ticks of entropy--time.  From the minimal postulate
$\Delta S = \Delta\tau$ and the one--hop--per--tick rule, all physical structure
follows as operational bookkeeping on a discrete causal substrate.  The stitch
rate $c$ becomes the calibration between native tick units and SI measure,
demonstrating how ambient geometry is recovered statistically and how weak--field
clocks obey the canonical relation $\Delta\nu/\nu = \beta\,\Delta\Phi/c^2$.
This article establishes the axioms, operational scope, and falsifiers on which
all subsequent Planck--Cell papers are built.
