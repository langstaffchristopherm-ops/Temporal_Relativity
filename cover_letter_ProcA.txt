Subject: Submission to Proceedings A — "Temporal Relativity (ΔS=κΔτ)"

Dear Editors,

Please consider the enclosed manuscript, “Temporal Relativity (ΔS=κΔτ).”

Main results. From a tick-based entropy–time postulate, we derive a(N) ∝ N^(1/3) and H = (1/3)·ḊN/N, with interior Euclidean behavior and a finite-speed causal cone. In the weak-field regime the predicted slope is ≈ 1 within stated acceptance bands.

Falsifiability. The manuscript specifies explicit empirical falsifiers and acceptance bands.

Data accessibility. Code and data are archived at 10.5281/zenodo.17127328.

I confirm this work is submitted exclusively to Proceedings A; conflicts and funding are disclosed; I am submitting as an Independent researcher.

Sincerely,
Christopher M. Langstaff
